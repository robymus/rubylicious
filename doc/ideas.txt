Ideas, thingies:

Textures:
	- loadTexture(filename, optional cropping)
		-> does the converting: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/821244/sdl-surface-to-opengl-texture
		-> SDL_Surface + scaling factor (exposed to ruby)
		-> free (?)

Primitives:
	- vector2,3,4
	- matrix2,3,4

Mesh:
	- create from ruby (maybe loaders later? or implemented in ruby?)
	- indexed triangle mode
		- coordinates, triangles with indices
		- x,y,z
			- optional: nx,ny,nz
			- optional: u,v,w
			- extra optional data: maybe create a universal format with a map?
		- optional flat shade mode: triangle normals calculated
		- mandatory: fragment shader
	- triangle mode
		- same as indexed, but no list of vertices, list of triangles is with 3 vertex
	- quad mode
		- same as triangle, but quads (we don't do indexed quad, because just not)
	- prescale u/v based on texture
	- render

VertexShader thingy:
	- set a vertex shader
	- set parameters for the vertex shader (eg. matrix, global parameters, t, etc.)
	- rotation, camera, etc. set up in ruby
	- we can render multiple meshes (eg. an object) with the same vertex shader / parameters

Objects:
	- built in ruby, aggregate meshes

Particles:
	- TODO

Other interesting effects:
	- TODO
	
Setup, control:
	- resolution, window, double buffering, whatever
	- close sdl, exit everything
	- some kind of UI options later? (resolution select, etc.)

Events:
	- SDL events routed to ruby (event polling?)

Sound:
	- something is needed, with time sync, pause, etc.
	- debug: .wav (seeking, pause), later: .mp3
